**Typing Speed Test Readme**

The speed test program loads one of 10 inbuilt paragraphs for users to type and test their typing speed. There is the option to swap paragraph if the user wants.

The timer starts when you click into the text box, so make sure you're ready to start typing when you click into the box. The timer will end when the sentence in the textbox matches **exactly** what is shown; punctuation and upper/lower case must all match in this version of the application.

Once you have done one paragraph successfully you will see your words-per-minute score appear. The user's high score is tracked whie the application is running so you can attempt to beat your prior score.
